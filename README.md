# CodeSpaces-demo
Demo app for BelfastJS GitHub CodeSpaces talk. 
Demos are ironically the perfect usecase for a CodeSpace. 

## Creating the app
- ~~Create frontend (React)~~
- ~~Create backend~~ 
- ~~Get frontend and backend working nicely together~~
- ~~Make the app look nice~~ 
- ~~Create architecture diagram~~
- Complete `README.md` changes
- Fix any linting errors 

## Instructions 
1. Clone the repository
2. `npm install`
3. Install serverless framework 
3. Start backend first (`serverless offline`)
4. Start frontend (`cd frontend & npm run`)
5. Run the tests and linting 
6. Share the link with everyone 
7. Make some sort of change 


## Setup (secret)
1. Set up `bind-port` on my mac
2. Remove write permissions for `npm` dir
3. Change your node version - `sudo n 10.16.0`


**Uninstall serverless framework globally before talk**
2. Get your `.devcontainer.json` setup with eslint etc
3. (+ keyboard shortcuts, extensions, disable minimap)

## Issues I'll run into 
1. Cloning it 
2. Port conflict
3. Some sort of git issue? 2 branches? 
4. Installing sls 
5. Npx/npm mismatch issue (global and project level npm pkg versions)
6. MacBook Arm issue
